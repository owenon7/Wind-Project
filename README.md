# Wind-Project
Code from a project on wind power prediction from final year undergrad

The purpose was to develop an ML model from some given data on weather and wind generation and then predict wind generation given weather conditions. The code to be predicted on was held by the lecturer so is not here. 

My team received an A grade for the project and our model had the highest accuracy out of the class.
